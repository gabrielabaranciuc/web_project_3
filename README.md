**Intro**

This is a project about traveling across the US. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Description of the project and its functionality**

A responsive static webpage using HTML5 and CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid layout, Media Queries Transitions), following the BEM Naming Methodology.The project adapts to the width of various devices (from 320px to 1280px).

**Widths for breakpoints**

- 1280px and higher (standard laptops and beyond).
- from 1024px to 1280px (from a tablet in landscape to a standard laptop).
- from 768px to 1024px (from a tablet in portrait to a tablet in landscape).
- from 425px to 768px (from a large smartphone to a tablet in portrait).
- up to 425px (mobile devices).

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 

Good luck and have fun!
